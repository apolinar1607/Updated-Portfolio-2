# Update Portfolio 2

This project is an updated version of the 'Responsive Portfolio using Bootstrap' project.

## Project Notes

Some enhancement were done in this project particularly the use of Bootstrap 5 to re-design the pages.

Background image and google fonts were also added to improve the typography of the pages.


In the Portfolio page, three of the homeworks, project1 and project3 were highlighted.
