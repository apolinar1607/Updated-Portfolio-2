# Update Portfolio

This project is an updated version of the 'Responsive Portfolio using Bootstrap' project.

## Project Notes

Some enhancement were done in this project particularly the use of Bootstrap 5 to re-design the pages.

Background image and google fonts were also added to improve the typography of the pages.


In the Portfolio page, two of the homework assignments and project 1 were highlighted. 


To open the URL for the project or homework, click the green icon below each project/homework image:

Furthermore, in my Github page, I have update my Github profile with pinned repositories featuring project 1 and two exemplary assignments.
